# Virtual-Clinic-Website-Mockup
**This is a mockup design of a virtual clinic system developed in Figma. The aim of the project was to develop and optimize the UI/UX design of a virtual clinic that would score high on usability tests.**\
**<ins>NOTE:</ins>** The mockup design is a click-through model that first demonstrates the reponse to all possible erroneous input(i.e. wrong username and password) then it will demonstrate the output to correct input. For example, on the first login attempt as Patient a "Couldn't find account!" message is displayed. If continue button is pressed and a second login is attempted an "Incorrect password" message is displayed. If continue button is pressed, then a third login is attempted login will be successfull.
**There are three full system mockup designs for three stake-holders, namely a patient, a doctor and an admin.**
